  <p>
[7/8/2016 11:49:21 PM] there I was<br />
[7/8/2016 11:49:25 PM] a dark and stormy night here in Oklahoma<br />
[7/8/2016 11:49:39 PM] roads are wet<br />
[7/8/2016 11:50:04 PM] I'm just leaving my friend Keara's house<br />
[7/8/2016 11:50:31 PM] it starts raining harder than it has all day right as I leave the house<br />
[7/8/2016 11:50:52 PM] I know how to get home from there, I don't need a GPS I've driven back and forth from there many times<br />
[7/8/2016 11:51:39 PM] I'm on my way home thinking about things in my loneliness since y'know... driving... alone.<br />
[7/8/2016 11:52:18 PM] I'm getting closer to my house but also I've been thinking a LOT so y'know kinda emotional but that's a regular Daniel thing<br />
[7/8/2016 11:52:22 PM] so I'm like alrighty I wanna be home<br />
[7/8/2016 11:52:53 PM] I turn onto a street that's like a mile from my house and start to accelerate... as you do... driving<br />
[7/8/2016 11:53:34 PM] but this time the road was a bit too slick so I start to lose control and my car swerves left. like a dummy who didn't pay attention when everyone was like "don't try and correct the car just let it happen" I try to correct the turn<br />
[7/8/2016 11:54:08 PM] which makes me swerve right so I'm like :o and I try and correct that so I swerve left and I'm like :O so I correct THAT and go right and drive over the curb<br />
[7/8/2016 11:54:41 PM] I drive over the curb,. through hedges, into a cemetery<br />
[7/8/2016 11:55:05 PM] I'm a little frazzled at this point because I literally just drove off the road and ran over like thirteen people<br />
[7/8/2016 11:55:12 PM] they are 6 feet under the ground but hey still ran them over<br />
[7/8/2016 11:55:40 PM] so I'm like okay what do I do now<br />
[7/8/2016 11:55:45 PM] and I call my dad and I'm like "so uhhh"<br />
[7/8/2016 11:55:49 PM] "i need help?"<br />
[7/8/2016 11:55:54 PM] "I sorta got in an accident"<br />
[7/8/2016 11:55:59 PM] and he's like "I'm on my way"<br />
[7/8/2016 11:56:03 PM] he was at Whataburger<br />
[7/8/2016 11:56:06 PM] so he hangs the phone up bc I didn't want to do it what if the truck exploded or something lol<br />
[7/8/2016 11:57:09 PM] I try to drive a bit but I'm like really low to the ground and I can't like go<br />
[7/8/2016 11:57:18 PM] so I get out and THREE of my tires are popped<br />
[7/8/2016 11:57:24 PM] just like straight up hub cap to the ground hardcore<br />
[7/8/2016 11:57:43 PM] and I'm like "ooh yes I know NOT to drive with popped tires I've heard that before"<br />
[7/8/2016 11:57:45 PM] So I just sit there<br />
[7/8/2016 11:58:03 PM] and I'm like "okay I'm bored I'll call Keara" (the friend whose house I left)<br />
[7/8/2016 11:58:25 PM] so blah blah talk to her make jokes bc yolo just ran people over<br />
[7/8/2016 11:58:31 PM] I debated calling the cops but who does that lmao<br />
[7/8/2016 11:58:52 PM] my dad gets there and we go home to get like the insurance card or something to get a tow truck number<br />
[7/8/2016 11:59:06 PM] turns out that truck is THE ONE TRUCK NOT COVERED FOR TOWS<br />
[7/8/2016 11:59:44 PM] so I call a tow guy who is like rude and obnoxious and he's like "okay be there in 30 minutes"<br />
[7/8/2016 11:59:54 PM] so we drive back to the cemetery and sit next to the truck waiting for the tow truck<br />
[7/9/2016 12:00:00 AM] and a COP COMES OUT OF NOWHERE<br />
[12:00:23 AM] he's like "is this ur vehicle I saw some branches over there and decided to investigate"<br />
[12:00:33 AM] and my mom (who is deaf) is like uhhh<br />
[12:00:46 AM] and I roll down the window and I'm like "yeah uh I almost died lmao but ye"<br />
[12:00:51 AM] that's not really what I said but sorta<br />
[12:01:28 AM] he's like uh okay did you damage any property and I'm like uhh lmao idk I almost died I wasn't paying attention to like "okay Daniel be careful DRIVING INTO THIS CEMETERY TOTALLY ON PURPOSE"<br />
[12:02:06 AM] so he goes to investigate any damages and he comes back after like ten minutes and is like uh okay lemme see ur license and I give it to him and he like beeps on his little phone<br />
[12:02:14 AM] it's this moment that I realize this guy isn't a cop<br />
[12:02:27 AM] he's a security guard for the cemetery<br />
[12:02:56 AM] he's doing things on his phone or whatever and he's like okay uh we'll contact you if we need to sue you or something for damages lmao<br />
[12:03:02 AM] and I'm like uh okay<br />
[12:03:05 AM] and the tow truck gets there<br />
[12:03:43 AM] so I go to stand out in the rain and explain to this tow truck guy and he's like "uh lol did u do any damage to the property" and I'm like "UH LMAO IDK"<br />
[12:03:53 AM] also the tow truck guy on the phone asked the same thing<br />
[12:03:58 AM] so APPARENTLY WHEN U GET IN A WRECK<br />
[12:04:01 AM] AND POSSIBLY ALMOST SORTA DIE<br />
[12:04:07 AM] PEOPLE ONLY CARE ABOOUT THE DEAD PEOPLE<br />
[12:04:09 AM] AND THE BUSHES<br />
[12:04:33 AM] he hooks up the truck and finds a branch in the bottom of the truck and I'm like uh lol wasn't me<br />
[12:05:01 AM] jk I didn't say that but he takes the truck to the repair place for us to take care of in the morning<br />
[12:05:04 AM] and this point I'm wet<br />
[12:05:04 AM] cold<br />
[12:05:09 AM] and REALLY HAVE TO PEE<br />
[12:05:30 AM] we get to the repair place and the tow truck guy just sits in his truck for like ten minutes!!! for no! apparent! reason!<br />
[12:05:40 AM] then he's like "aight pls pay me lol" and we pay him<br />
[12:05:55 AM] he takes 20 minutes to lower the truck off the tow truck into a spot<br />
[12:06:19 AM] then he's like lol ur gear shift is broken and I'm like "hur dur I totally didn't realize that when I tried to drive away or park"<br />
[12:07:07 AM] he's like "call the repair people first thing in the morning and tell them ur gear is stuck in drive or they might jack it up and the truck will roll into the building"<br />
[12:07:19 AM] keep in mind THE TIRES ARE FLAT THE TRUCK ISN'T ROLLING ANYWHERE<br />
[12:07:50 AM] he's like "k lol have a good night"<br />
[12:07:57 AM] and we're like uh kthxbai<br />
[12:08:01 AM] then I go home and pee<br />
[12:08:29 AM] that's the story of how I ruined 3 tires, ran over some people, and got annoyed by some people asking me if I "damaged property"<br />
[12:08:41 AM] at no point was I ever asked "uh are YOU alright tho man?"<br />
[12:08:51 AM] El Fin.<br />
